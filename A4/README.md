## How to LCA in BIM

To conduct a building LCA, one must access a various of different quantities and materials. Furthermore, the selection of all or a few impact categories must be chosen. So, there is a few things to take into account.. and many surprises along the way when combining LCA with BIM.

Therefore, this teaching tutorial will highlight three "_good-to-know before you start_" factors: 
- Units, units and units
- Extraction of materials and how they are all related
- I have my material names - what now?

### Units, units and units
When conducting a LCA, the units are very important, as they relate the material to the emission factor. However, it is not always easy to determine if one are extracting the IFC unit or the e.g., BlenderBIM unit.
