### Your learning experience for the concept you focused on.
- Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended

- What else do you still need to learn?
  
- How you might use OpenBIM in the future?

---

### Your process of developing the tutorial
- Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?

  
- Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?

  
- Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?

### (As a group) summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial
Did the tool address the use case you identified?

Our A3 tool adresses the overall goals for an LCA, as our tool is scripted to both calculate GWP and compare GWP of materials for exterior walls. 
Therefore, yes, our tool adresses the use case we identified, since the case was the comparison of GWP. However, we did not explicitly state whether a report statement was correct or incorrect, but we stated the importance of assessing different materials. 

The recieved feedback on our A4 tutorial (which highlighted three main difficulties we ran into when developing our A3 tool) consisted of: (1) at least one group would use our tutorial. (2) the another _Materials_ group could see the tool/tutorial implemented in the A phase as well as later on in the design phase. (3) the professor asked what had caused us the biggest problems, to which we answered "the units, and the fact that we could not develop a tool that was able to fully automatically calculate GWP without user input".

... maybe

- are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years?
Hopefully, yes, as it would optimize many manual processes. As the building sector (very) slowly transitions to becoming more digital—collaborating across sectors and adopting new, more effective tools, I am sure that OpenBIM will be implemented along the way. Furthermore, with the ongoing integration of AI, coding, and similar technologies across most sectors, I believe it is almost inevitable that OpenBIM will not play a role in professional my life within the next 10 years.
