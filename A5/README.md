### Your learning experience for the concept you focused on (answered by the group)
- _Identify your own level at the beginning of this course and where you ended_

At the start of the course, we were all relatively new to BIM and had only worked with it as BIM modellers in a few previous courses. By the end of this course, we have gained more confidence in analysing and working with BIM models and developed a clearer understanding of both the advantages and challenges of BIM. We now consider ourselves to be at the _Self Learners_ level of BIM.

- _What else do you still need to learn?_

We still need to improve our understanding of how BIM-related data and information connect and how to streamline these processes in practice and across disciplines. 
  
- _How you might use OpenBIM in the future?_

We expect to use OpenBIM in our future professional work, especially for coordinating information across disciplines.

### Your process of developing the tutorial (answered by the group)
- _Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?_

The course definetly increased our knowledge of OpenBIM - what the benefits are, but also which challenges it comes with. So to answer whether the course enabled us to answer of define questions that we might need for our individually thesis', yes to an extend.  
  
- _Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?_

Yes and no. Since (almost) no boundaries for choosing use cases were defined, it was very difficult to decide what to focus on. On one hand, we felt we had too many options due to the lack of restrictions; on the other hand, we felt very limited because of our chosen focus area. In retrospect, we think it was a good challenge for us to define what we wanted to focus on ourselves, as most courses we have previously attended at DTU had strict guidelines. Those undoubtedly made it easier to start tasks quickly and efficiently, but perhaps left less room for reflection on what we wanted to work on.

  
- _Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?_
  
Overall, yes. We think that the number of tools aligned with our own development throughout the course. However, we think that the guidelines for the A4 tutorial tool were a bit difficult to understand, which is also why, we guess that some groups only presented their A3 tools and some other groups presented something quite different.

### Summary of the feedback you received on your tutorial (answered by the group)
_Did the tool address the use case you identified?_

Our A3 tool addresses the overall goals of an LCA, as it is scripted to both calculate GWP and compare the GWP of materials for exterior walls. 
Therefore, yes, our tool addresses the identified use case, since the case focused on comparing GWP. However, we did not explicitly state whether a report statement was correct or incorrect; instead, we emphasized the importance of assessing different materials.

1) overall good work
2) could be nice with automapping, however, challenge
3) inhomogeneous layers


The feedback we received on our A4 tutorial (which highlighted three main difficulties encountered during the development of our A3 tool) was as follows: (1) at least one group indicated they would use our tutorial; (2) the another Materials group suggested that the tool/tutorial could be implemented in the A phase as well as later in the design phase; (3) the professor asked what caused us the biggest challenges, to which we responded: “the units, and the fact that we could not develop a tool capable of fully automatically calculating GWP without user input.”

### Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM (answered individually)

**s216096**
- _Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?_

I find OpenBIM very interesting, but I am still a bit unsure whether I will use it in my thesis, especially since I haven’t decided on the topic yet. But OpenBIM is still somewhat complex, yet it aligns well with areas such as building modelling, indoor climate and LCA. Because of this, OpenBIM may find a place in my thesis.
  
- _Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years?_

The construction industry is gradually integrating OpenBIM, and it is becoming more widely adopted. Because of this development, it is quite likely that I will end up using OpenBIM in my professional life. I also found the presentations from SWECO and NEE very interesting, and I can easily see myself working in a company like that. I am excited to see where OpenBIM will be in 10 years.
  
**s223929**
- _Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?_

Although I have not yet chosen a thesis topic, I expect that I may use OpenBIM tools. This course has shown that OpenBIM can be applied across many areas of a building project (structures, indoor environment, cost, etc.), so it is definitely worth keeping in mind for perspective.

- _Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years?_

It seems like the (very conservative) building sector is gradually becoming more open to adopting OpenBIM in professional practice. Also, with more and more newly educated professionals entering the industry, I think we will see a shift toward wider use of OpenBIM tools. Therefore, I expect to be able to use OpenBIM tools in my professional life within the next 10 years. 

**s223898**
- _Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis?_
  
I think I would have to develop my skills quite a bit to use OpenBim in my master thesis. But my plan (at least for now) is to write my thesis with LCA as the focus area - so, if I should implement OpenBIM, I could definetely use the knowledge I have gained during the development of our tool. 
  
- _Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professional life in the next 10 years?_
  
Hopefully, yes, as it would optimize many manual processes. As the building sector (very) slowly transitions to becoming more digital—collaborating across sectors and adopting new, more effective tools, I am sure that OpenBIM will be implemented along the way. Furthermore, with the ongoing integration of AI, coding, and similar technologies across most sectors, I believe it is almost inevitable that OpenBIM will not play a role in professional my life within the next 10 years.

### Wrap up (answered individually)
_Conclude the journey through A1-A5_

**s216096**

Even though I had taken a BIM course before, this process was something completely different, because I had never tried developing an actual tool or analyzing an IFC file through code. So even with a basic understanding of BIM, the beginning still felt quite challenging, mainly because combining Python with OpenBIM logic was completely new to me.

In A1, I realized how much more complex BIM becomes when you don’t just model, but start extracting data and working with it. I went from being able to “work in models” to actually understanding IFC as a data structure. This was also where we decided to work with LCA and where we developed a simple piece of code that became the foundation for the entire A3 assignment.

A2 gave me a better understanding of how data, materials, and processes connect on a more technical level, and it really helped me how to structure the workflow around our use case. It was diffecult to develop a tool that would actually be useful for others, as it required balancing technical complexity with usability. Overall, A2 made the following assignments easier to approach.

A3 was definitely the most challenging part. Not because of BIM itself, but because I had never tried building a script that needed to produce a specific result that was actually useful. It required a lot of debugging and many attempts to get units, materials, and IFC relationships to work together. 

A4 made it clear why our A3 process had been so challenging. There are many pitfalls when you combine LCA, IFC, and Python. At the same time, it gave me a better understanding of which parts of BIM actually represent the biggest barriers to automation.

All in all, A1–A5 taught me something completely new about BIM, how to move from model to data, and from data to functional tools. I entered the course with experience in BIM modelling, but I am leaving it with a much stronger understanding of OpenBIM, IFC structures, and coding. It has been challenging, but also incredibly motivating, and it’s definitely something I can use in the future.

My learning journey through the course has been 


**s223898**

My personal journey through the A1-A5 assignment has been a steep learning curve. Before taking this course, I was not even aware that you could write a code capable of extracting quantities, materials, values etc. from an IFC file. So for A1, I was honestly just impressed that I/we could write code that actually worked. However, the problems related to extraction of materials already started here. I also think that using GitHub pushed me - in a good way - to adapt to a new collaborative workspace. 

The A2 assignment gave me a good overview of the possibilities with openBIM and how the different elements are meant to connect in the "right" way. Furthermore, it introcuded me to Markdown, which I now think is pretty cool. 

A3 was quite challenging both in terms of scripting and in terms of actually deciding what to script. I think this assignment challenged me the most, because we had endless possibilities for what we could code, yet limitations due to our focus area and the IFC models. 
During the scripting, we ran into many difficulties, that we later choose to base our A4 assignment on. These challenges created a lot of questions and frustration, because it was often difficult to distinguish whether the issue came from my (low) scripting skills or from the IFc model simply not being detailed enough for what I wanted to extract. 
Problems about inconsistant IFC and BIM units and not being able to automatically map materials to an EPD were frustrating, but they also highlighted what the building and architecture sector still needs to develop. What I gained most from this iterative process was learing to stay in a development mindset - something I don't do often, neither at DTU nor in my everyday life.

I think that A4 reflected many of the same challenges as A3, partly because we worked on them simultaneously. Since we choose to highlight the three main issues when combining LCA with OpenBIM, I believe A4 gave me an even better understanding of both our A3 tool and OpenBIM in general (even though I am aware I have only scrathed the surface of its full potential). 

Overall, I believe this journey has given me insight into a new way of thinking about engineering and the possibilities in the sector.
