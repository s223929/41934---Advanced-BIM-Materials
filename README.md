**Our script** 

Our script counts and lists the model's different roof types. 
Furthermore, our script counts and lists all unique materials used in the roofs.

Our script found, that only **8** unique materials are used in the Ifc model and **not** 13 unique materials as the report states.

**For Managers:**

Analyst Group 33: https://github.com/GustavS193940/BIManalyst_33_Sustainability.git

Group 33's script calculated the net floor area (NFA) and compare it to the stated floor area in the report. 
The script returns TRUE if the calculated NFA is within a error margin of X.
